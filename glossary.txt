M4V - The M4V file format is a video file format developed by Apple and is
  very close to the MP4 format.  The differences are the optional Apple's
  DRM copy protection, and the treatment of AC3 (Dolby Digital) audio which
  is not standardized for the MP4 container.

Matroska - extensible, open source, open standard Multimedia container.
  Matroska is usually found as .MKV files (matroska video), .MKA files
  (matroska audio) and .MKS files (subtitles) and .MK3D files
  (stereoscopic/3D video).  It is also the basis for .webm (WebM) files.

MKV - MKV is just a container format, it can hold video in any number of
  formats audio etc, it has no menu structure though which is something
  an ISO image of a disc can retain.

  what MakeMKV does is take the original source and essentially "repackage"
  the original video and audio in a new container.  No menus or anything but
  it maintains the original quality (no re-encoding involved).  If the
  original was a DVD you'll end up with a 4-8 gb standard def file, if it
  was a blu-ray you end up with a 12-40 gb HD file. PLEX VIDEO_TS OR .VOB
  FILE WORK AROUND THIS WILL ALLOW PLEX TO STREAM YOUR VIDEO_TS OR .VOB FILES

rip - Ripping is the process of copying audio or video content to a hard disk,
  typically from removable media such as compact disc (CD) or DVD, although
  the word refers to all forms of media.  Despite the name, neither the media
  nor the data is damaged after extraction.  Ripping is often used to shift
  formats, and to edit, duplicate or back up media content.
