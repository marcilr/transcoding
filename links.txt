HandBrake is a multi-threaded DVD to MPEG-4 ripper and converter.
It can encode directly from DVDs (even encrypted ones) or from VIDEO_TS
folders.  AC3, LPCM, and MPEG audio tracks are supported.  The output
can be contained in MP4, AVI, or OGM files, and the output audio is
encoded in either AAC, MP3, or Vorbis.  Other features include support
for 2-pass encoding, encoding of two audio tracks, a bitrate calculator,
and deinterlacing, cropping, and scaling of the original picture.

The Wretched State of GPU Transcoding
Posted by Soulskill on Tuesday May 08, @06:57PM
from the things-that-should-work-better-in-2012 dept.
"This story began as an investigation into why Cyberlink's Media Espresso
software produced video files of wildly varying quality and size depending
on which GPU was used for the task.  It then expanded into a comparison of
several alternate solutions. Our goal was to find a program that would
encode at a reasonably high quality level (~1GB per hour was the target)
and require a minimal level of expertise from the user.  The conclusion,
after weeks of work and going blind staring at enlarged images, is that
the state of 'consumer' GPU transcoding is still a long, long way from
prime time use.  In short, it's simply not worth using the GPU to
accelerate your video transcodes; it's much better to simply use Handbrake,
which uses your CPU."

MP4 for Flash in Linux
Flash version 9 can play mp4 streams.  This document describes how to
transcode an arbitrary video file to an mp4 file suitable for streaming
to a web browser.

MPEG-4 contains two advanced video codecs that provides higher quality
per kilobit than MPEG-2.  The trade off is additional CPU power is required
to encode and decode the video.  H.264 is the most common variant of MPEG-4
MythTV recordings.

Ripping is the process of copying audio or video content to a hard disk,
typically from removable media such as compact disc (CD) or DVD, although
the word refers to all forms of media.  Despite the name, neither the media
nor the data is damaged after extraction.  Ripping is often used to shift
formats, and to edit, duplicate or back up media content.
