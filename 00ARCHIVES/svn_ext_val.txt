# dvdrip/               dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written
#                       in Perl.  It provides an easy to use but feature-rich
#                       Gtk+ GUI to control almost all aspects of the ripping
#                       and transcoding process.  It uses the widely known
#                       video processing swissknife transcode and many other
#                       Open Source tools.  dvd::rip itself is licensed under
#                       GPL / Perl Artistic License.
#                       "And note: it's spelt dvd::rip, and nothing else."

# makemkv/              MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video
#                       that you own into free and patents-unencumbered format

#                       converter, otherwise called "transcoder".  It converts

#                       encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
#                       most information but not changing it in any way.
