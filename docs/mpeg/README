  MPEG-4 is a method of defining compression of audio and visual
  (AV) digital data.  It was introduced in late 1998 and designated
  a standard for a group of audio and video coding formats and
  related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture
  Experts Group (MPEG) (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11) under the formal
  standard ISO/IEC 14496 - Coding of audio-visual objects.  Uses of
  MPEG-4 include compression of AV data for web (streaming media)
  and CD distribution, voice (telephone, videophone) and broadcast
  television applications.
