MPEG-4 is a method of defining compression of audio and visual
(AV) digital data.  It was introduced in late 1998 and designated
a standard for a group of audio and video coding formats and
related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture
Experts Group (MPEG) (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11) under the formal
standard ISO/IEC 14496 - Coding of audio-visual objects.  Uses of
MPEG-4 include compression of AV data for web (streaming media)
and CD distribution, voice (telephone, videophone) and broadcast
television applications.

-------------------------------
MPEG4 is a newer, more efficient (more compression) video compression
technology.  It requires more signal processing power, but should
yield equivalent video results to the current (older) MPEG2
compression technology.
