Copy vs. Encode


When to copy, when to encode?
=============================
You might not have thought about this before, but sometimes, you want to just copy the contents of
a video and not re-encode.  This is actually very critical when just cutting out portions from a
file, or only changing containers (and not the codecs inside).

The following command is wrong: It will re-encode your video.  It will take
forever, and the result will (probably) look bad.

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mkv

What FFmpeg did here was encoding the file yet another time, because you didn't tell it to copy.
This command however does it right:

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv

Or got mp4 to m4v, what I want to do:

    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.m4v
