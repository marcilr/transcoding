Atomic Parsley


Set iTunes style metadata with alacrity...
..or purge them with the metaEnema


	
AtomicParsley is a lightweight command line program for reading, parsing and setting metadata
into MPEG-4 files supporting these styles of metadata:

o iTunes-style metadata into .mp4, .m4a, .m4p, .m4v, .m4b files
o 3gp-style assets (3GPP TS 26.444 version 6.4.0 Release 6 specification conforming)
  in 3GPP, 3GPP2, MobileMP4 & derivatives
o ISO copyright notices at movie & track level for MPEG-4 & derivative files
o uuid private user extension text & file embedding for MPEG-4 & derivative files

The MPEG-4 container is based on Apple's Quicktime .mov container (just more sane) & there
are a number of similarites - as well as differences.  Each MPEG-4 file lists a "major file
brand" that broadly says which specification the file adheres to.  For example, an iTunes
audio file typically lists 'M4A ' as its major file brand, while a 3GPP2 .3g2 file has
something like '3g2a'.  It is based on this major file brand that AtomicParsley allows a
style of metadata to be set.  Since there is nothing in the 3GPP2 specification regarding
iTunes-style metadata, its use is prevented on such files.  Similarly, a 3gp 'location' asset
is not available for an iTMS video file.  The first paragraph here[1] sums the situation up
well.

With the exception of artwork, all iTunes-style tags support only 1 piece of metadata - you
can't have for example 3 title tags. 3gp assets and copyright notices support multiple tags,
but they must differ in the language setting for that tag.  You can have for example 3 title
tags, but 1 in english, 1 in spanish, 1 in undefined.  All iTunes-style text metadata is
always in UTF-8; 3gp assets & copyright notices can be in set in UTF-8 or UTF-16.  All
strings are converted internally to UTF-8, converting as necessary.  On *nix platforms,
input is in UTF-8; the native Windows port supports full UTF-16 input.
