transcoding.txt
  Transcoding is the process of the conversion of digital data (typically
  video and audio files) from one format to another.  It involves extracting
  tracks from a digital media file, decoding the tracks, filtering, encoding,
  and then multiplexing the new tracks into a new container.  Transcoding
  will reduce the quality of the tracks unless lossless formats are used.
